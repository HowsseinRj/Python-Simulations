## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Regression, Random Forest)
- GUI Development with Tkinter
- Simulation & Visualization for Mechanical Applications

---

## 📂 Project Highlights

### ⚙️ `engine_efficiency_plot.py`
A simple script to plot engine efficiency as a function of load.  
Visualizes mechanical efficiency trends and helps in understanding real-world performance.

---

### 🔥 `pipe_heat_loss.py`
Simulates heat loss in a pipe using basic heat transfer equations.  
Good for students learning conduction & convection concepts in thermal engineering.

---

### 🤖 `fuel_efficiency_prediction.py`
Basic ML model to predict car fuel consumption (MPG) using simple linear regression.  
Inputs include weight, horsepower, and number of cylinders.

---

### 🧠 `fuel_efficiency_ml_advanced.py`
Advanced ML pipeline with:
- Real-world dataset (Auto MPG)
- Linear Regression vs. Random Forest
- R² and MAE model comparison
- Predictive visualization plot

---

### 🖥️ `fuel_predict_gui.py`
A desktop GUI application using `Tkinter` that allows users to input car specs and predict fuel efficiency in real-time.  
💾 Uses trained ML model from `train_model.py`

---

### 🧪 `train_model.py`
Trains and saves a Random Forest regression model using a real-world dataset.  
Used later in the GUI application.
